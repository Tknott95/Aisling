Cross-Chain Mobile Minting and Mining


This is my mobile app, micro-service based connector to the "Honey Badger Miner". The "Honey Badger Miner" is not open sourced atm. This is a  mobile app that lets you connect from anywhere. It is unfinished atm as I have been busy with other projects. 

#### Will ship full e2e, with both apps, when I have some spare time.
- remote mining
- remote fan control
- safety thresholds
- start and stop switches
- remote clocking
- etc
