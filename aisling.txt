#### Abstract
```
 Two apps will be delivered, yet for the hackathon, I will pack all into one to show the power of plugging such modules together.

 Mining, Clocking, Thresholds and so forth all from a mobile app. Not only this, but a cross chain archiver. For the hackathon I will be using ifps but I will be doing fun things once I have time to extend this idea dn fight against censorship. There will be a system in place for cross chain minting. I will show the power of this possibly from the mobile app. Through any iot you should be able to mint cross chain with this infrasctructure. I would go deeper into detail yet I need to protect my ideas. This will allow for infrastrucure to be built on top in the future to fight censorship. This is all I will say about this app for now. This will be part of the mining app or a seperate entry. It is really up to ERG if they will allow for me to enter two projects.

This is an extension of logic from internal apps names Platform137 and Platform34. Both apps I have written in the past. Everything is in place to get this done and I already know what to do. Honestly, I might have time to run with further modules and ideas. Again, I can't reveal it all.
